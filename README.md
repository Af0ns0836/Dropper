## Description of the game

"Dropper" is an engrossing and strategic board game that combines tactical placement, clever maneuvers, and an intense quest for territorial supremacy. Players will face off on an 8x8 board, although variations of the game can be played on boards of different sizes, making it adaptable to your preferred challenge level.

**Objective:**
The goal of "Stone Dominance" is to strategically place your stones on the board and form the most extensive groups of stones compared to your opponent. A "group" in the game consists of a single stone or a set of stones of the same color adjacent orthogonally.

**Gameplay:**
The game begins with the first player placing a single stone of their choice on the empty board, setting the stage for the strategic battle that's about to unfold. The second player, in response, deploys a pair of stones using a two-step protocol, namely "1Drop - 1Free." Here's how this protocol works:

**1Drop:**
In the first part of the protocol, the second player places one of their stones in the location of one of their opponent's stones. This move forces the opponent's stone to be moved to a free square that is adjacent either diagonally or orthogonally. This strategic maneuver can disrupt your opponent's planned formations.

**1Free:**
In the second part of the protocol, the second player places their own stone on an empty square that has no stones adjacent to it in any direction, diagonally or orthogonally. This move allows the player to assert control over the board and secure positions that are strategically advantageous.

Players continue to take turns, following the "1Drop - 1Free" protocol until it is no longer possible to make "Free" moves. Once this point is reached, players proceed with "Drop" moves only. In the "Drop" moves, players attempt to strategically place their stones in a manner that maximizes the size of their stone groups.

**Victory:**
The game's outcome is determined by the size of the stone groups that each player has formed when placement possibilities are exhausted. The player with the largest group is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the size of the second-largest group is counted, and so on until a victor is determined. Strategy and foresight are crucial in ensuring that your stone groups are the largest on the board.
